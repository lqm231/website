                    <p>Assuming you are on windows:</p>

                    <p>What I always do is use <code>subst</code> to create a driveletter asccociation with part of the path.</p>

                    <p>Then go to the new driveletter and navigate to the files that have long names. You should now be able to rename/delete/etc them. The reason this works is because the path itself is no longer containing &gt;255 chars.</p>

                    <h1>To create a subst folder</h1>

                    <ol>
                    <li>Start a commandprompt (no admin privileges needed)</li>
                    <li>Use <code>cd</code> to navigate to the folder you want to go (you can use <kbd>tab</kbd> to autocomplete names</li>
                    <li>type <code>subst j: .</code> to create the driveletter association. (instead of the . you can also type the entire path)</li>
                    <li>Now in explorer you have a new letter. Go to it and do whatever you need to do to the .cache files.</li>
                    <li>Go back to your cmd window and type <code>subst /d j:</code> to remove the drive or alternatively, restart your pc.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>EDIT: A trick I learned which can shorten this quite a bit. From the explorer window where you have trouble, click the addressbar so you can type in it, then type <code>cmd</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start a command prompt at that location, then proceed at step 3. :)</p>

                    <p>EDIT2: Okay, this trick can be expanded even further.
                    If you are in explorer at the right path, just type in <code>subst j: .</code> in the addressbar and press enter. A command window will pop up, execute the command and close again, and there you go, a new drive pops up in explorer.</p>
